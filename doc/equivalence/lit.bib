abstract="Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving is a fundamental problem in computer science. Finding efficient algorithms for SAT solving has broad implications in many areas of computer science and beyond. Quantum SAT solvers have been proposed in the literature based on Grover's algorithm. Although existing quantum SAT solvers can consider all possible inputs at once, they evaluate each clause in the formula one by one sequentially, making the time complexity O(m), linear to the number of clauses m, per Grover iteration. In this work, we develop a parallel quantum SAT solver, which reduces the time complexity in each iteration to constant time O(1) by utilising extra entangled qubits. To further improve the scalability of our solution in case of extremely large problems, we develop a distributed version of the proposed parallel SAT solver based on quantum teleportation such that the total qubits required are shared and distributed among a set of quantum computers (nodes), and the quantum SAT solving is accomplished collaboratively by all the nodes. We prove the correctness of our approaches and evaluate them in simulations and real quantum computers.",

abstract = {Generic quantum-circuit simulation appears intractable for conventional computers and may be unnecessary because useful quantum circuits exhibit significant structure that can be exploited during simulation. For example, Gottesman and Knill identified an important subclass, called stabilizer circuits, which can be simulated efficiently using group-theory techniques and insights from quantum physics. Realistic circuits enriched with quantum error-correcting codes and fault-tolerant procedures are dominated by stabilizer subcircuits and contain a relatively small number of non-Clifford components. Therefore, we develop new data structures and algorithms that facilitate parallel simulation of such circuits. Stabilizer frames offer more compact storage than previous approaches but require more sophisticated bookkeeping. Our implementation, called ${\tt Quipu}$ , simulates certain quantum arithmetic circuits (e.g., reversible ripple-carry adders) in polynomial time and space for equal superpositions of $n$ -qubits. On such instances, known linear-algebraic simulation techniques, such as the (state-of-the-art) BDD-based simulator ${\tt QuIDDPro}$ , take exponential time. We simulate quantum Fourier transform and quantum fault-tolerant circuits using ${\tt Quipu}$ , and the results demonstrate that our stabilizer-based technique empirically outperforms ${\tt QuIDDPro}$ in all cases. While previous high-performance, structure-aware simulations of quantum circuits were difficult to parallellize, we demonstrate that ${\tt Quipu}$ can be parallelized with a nontrivial computational speedup.},

abstract = {We describe a graphical calculus for completely positive maps and in doing so review the theory of open quantum systems and other fundamental primitives of quantum information theory using the language of tensor networks. In particular we demonstrate the construction of tensor networks to pictographically represent the Liouville-superoperator, Choi-matrix, process-matrix, Kraus, and system-environment representations for the evolution of quantum states, review how these representations interrelate, and illustrate how graphical manipulations of the tensor networks may be used to concisely transform between them. To further demonstrate the utility of the presented graphical calculus we include several examples where we provide arguably simpler graphical proofs of several useful quantities in quantum information theory including the composition and contraction of multipartite channels, a condition for whether an arbitrary bipartite state may be used for ancilla assisted process tomography, and the derivation of expressions for the average gate fidelity and entanglement fidelity of a channel in terms of each of the different representations of the channel.},

abstract = {This is a partly non-technical introduction to selected topics on tensor network methods, based on several lectures and introductory seminars given on the subject. It should be a good place for newcomers to get familiarized with some of the key ideas in the field, specially regarding the numerics. After a very general introduction we motivate the concept of tensor network and provide several examples. We then move on to explain some basics about Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS). Selected details on some of the associated numerical methods for 1d and 2d quantum lattice systems are also discussed.}

abstract = {A revised version of the massively parallel simulator of a universal quantum computer, described in this journal eleven years ago, is used to benchmark various gate-based quantum algorithms on some of the most powerful supercomputers that exist today. Adaptive encoding of the wave function reduces the memory requirement by a factor of eight, making it possible to simulate universal quantum computers with up to 48 qubits on the Sunway TaihuLight and on the K computer. The simulator exhibits close-to-ideal weak-scaling behavior on the Sunway TaihuLight, on the K computer, on an IBM Blue Gene/Q, and on Intel Xeon based clusters, implying that the combination of parallelization and hardware can track the exponential scaling due to the increasing number of qubits. Results of executing simple quantum circuits and Shor’s factorization algorithm on quantum computers containing up to 48 qubits are presented.}
